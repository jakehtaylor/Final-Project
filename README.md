INTRODUCTION
Education is a key factor for achieving long term economic progress. Our project intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using Machine Learning modeling techniques. 

Should we care about Student Performance models? 
YES

As a direct outcome of this project, more efficient student prediction tools can be  developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that we have access to socio-economic data from various school districts.
